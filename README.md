## Description

The application, at its core, is a user-friendly web platform designed to summarize online articles. With an intuitive interface, it streamlines the process of extracting key information from vast amounts of web conten

### Motivation

In today's information age, the internet is saturated with an overwhelming volume of content. While this bounty of information is invaluable, it presents a distinct challenge: How does one sift through endless articles to extract the essence of the content without investing excessive time? This challenge was the genesis of our article summarization application.

<a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Table of Contents</a>
### Why I Built This

I created this application to help users quickly understand the core of an article without reading it entirely. Additionally, I added a light/dark mode for a comfortable reading experience, addressing the varied preferences of users and enhancing overall usability.

### Problem Solved

The application bridges the gap between information overload and the time-starved modern individual. With a simple copy-paste mechanism, users can retrieve concise summaries of articles, aiding in quick comprehension and decision-making. Instead of wading through verbose content, users get the crux of the article, saving time and cognitive effort.

### What I Learned

Building this application was not just about solving a problem, but also a journey of growth and discovery.

**Technical Skills:**  
I honed my proficiency with React, particularly diving deeper into hooks like useState and useEffect. Additionally, integrating Tailwind for styling and theming provided a hands-on experience with modern CSS frameworks.

**UX/UI Design:**  
The importance of intuitive design was reiterated. Realizing that users might return to previously summarized articles led to the addition of a 'Previously Searched' feature, emphasizing the role of anticipating user needs in design.

**Problem Solving:**  
The project underscored the significance of iterative development. Initial versions of the application served the basic summarization function, but feedback and user testing led to refinements like the light/dark mode toggle.

**Persistence and Patience:**  
As with any project, there were hurdles â€” from debugging unexpected behaviors to refining the summary algorithm for optimal results. Each challenge reinforced the values of persistence, patience, and continuous learning.

This will start the development server, and the application should open in your default web browser.

2. **Enter an Article URL**: On the main page, you'll see an input box where you can paste or type in the URL of an online article you'd like to summarize.

3. **Get the Summary**: Click the submit button (or hit the `Enter` key) after entering the URL. In a short while, the application will provide a concise summary of the article.

4. **Switch Themes**: You can toggle between light and dark mode by using the theme switch button located on the top right of the application.

5. **Review Previous Searches**: The app saves your previous article searches for easy access. Just scroll down on the main page to see your previously summarized articles. Click on any previous article to view its summary again.

6. **Copy Article URL**: Next to each previously summarized article, there's a copy button. Clicking this will copy the article's URL to your clipboard.
